Cocoa Powder: The most important ingredient contributing to the flavor of the eggless chocolate cake is cocoa powder. It is important to use a good quality cocoa powder as this will affect the overall taste of the cake. Do not use dutch-process cocoa powder.
Whole Wheat Flour: This cake does not have the denseness or heaviness which wheat flour cakes may have. It is too difficult to guess or believe that this eggless cake is made from whole wheat flour if the texture is considered. It is incredibly light and soft. Though you will get a nutty wheat flour flavor in the cake. Use any good brand or good quality whole wheat flour.
Baking Soda: The most important ingredient affecting the texture of the cake is the baking soda and it is important that it is fresh. If the baking soda is not fresh or past its shelf life, the eggless cake will not rise. In the FAQ section below, I cover how to test the freshness of your baking soda.
Lemon Juice: As explained earlier, the lemon juice is also crucial in causing the eggless cake to rise properly. However, if you donâ€™t have lemon juice, white vinegar or apple cider vinegar can be used for the same effect.
Oil: Do use oil which has neutral flavors. For all my cake recipes, I always use sunflower oil as it is bland, neutral and there is no after taste felt in the cake. Oil also helps in making the eggless cake soft and moist.
